# Calico

## Environment
This demonstration makes some assumptions about the environment you have. See [EnvironmentSetup](EnvironmentSetup.md) for instructions on getting an appropriate environment.

If you have everything set up properly you should have the following hosts and should have calicoctl in your $PATH.

| hostname  | IP address   |
|-----------|--------------|
| calico-01 | 172.17.8.101 |
| calico-02 | 172.17.8.102 |

## Starting Calico services<a id="calico-services"></a>

Once you have your cluster up and running, start calico on all the nodes

On calico-01

    sudo calicoctl node

On calico-02

    sudo calicoctl node

This will start a container on each host. Check they are running

    docker ps

You should see output like this on each node

    vagrant@calico-01:~$ docker ps -a
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES
    39de206f7499        calico/node:v0.5.2   "/sbin/my_init"        2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes                                                         calico-node

## Networking containers.


### Starting containers
Let's go ahead and start a few of containers on each host.

On calico-01

    docker run --net=none --name workload-A -tid busybox
    docker run --net=none --name workload-B -tid busybox
    docker run --net=none --name workload-C -tid busybox

On calico-02

    docker run --net=none --name workload-D -tid busybox
    docker run --net=none --name workload-E -tid busybox

### Adding Calico networking
Now that docker is running the containers, we can use `calicoctl` to add networking to them.

On calico-01

    sudo calicoctl container add workload-A 192.168.0.1
    sudo calicoctl container add workload-B 192.168.0.2
    sudo calicoctl container add workload-C 192.168.0.3

On calico-02

    sudo calicoctl container add workload-D 192.168.0.4
    sudo calicoctl container add workload-E 192.168.0.5
    
Once the containers have Calico networking added, they gain a new network interface the the assigned IP address.
At this point, the containers have not been added to any policy profiles so they won't be able to communicate with any other containers.

Create some profiles (this can be done on either host)

    calicoctl profile add PROF_A_C_E
    calicoctl profile add PROF_B
    calicoctl profile add PROF_D

When each container is added to calico, an "endpoint" is registered for each container's interface. Containers are only allowed to communicate with one another when both of their endpoints are assigned the same profile. To assign a profile to an endpoint, we will first get the endpoint's ID with `calicoctl container <CONTAINER> endpoint-id show`, then paste it into the `calicoctl endpoint <ENDPOINT_ID> profile append [<PROFILES>]`  command.

On core-01:

    
    calicoctl endpoint $(calicoctl container workload-A endpoint-id show) profile append PROF_A_C_E
    calicoctl endpoint $(calicoctl container workload-B endpoint-id show) profile append PROF_B
    calicoctl endpoint $(calicoctl container workload-C endpoint-id show) profile append PROF_A_C_E

On core-02:

    calicoctl endpoint $(calicoctl container workload-D endpoint-id show) profile append PROF_D
    calicoctl endpoint $(calicoctl container workload-E endpoint-id show) profile append PROF_A_C_E

*Note that creating a new profile with `calicoctl profile add` will work on any Calico node, but assigning an endpoint a profile with `calicoctl endpoint <ENDPOINT_ID> profile append` will only work on the Calico node where the container is hosted.*


### Testing it
By default, profiles are configured so that their members can communicate with one another, but workloads in other profiles cannot reach them.
A, C and E are all in the same profile so should be able to ping each other.  B and D are in their own profile so shouldn't be able to ping anyone else.
    
Now, check that A can ping C (192.168.0.3) and E (192.168.0.5):

    docker exec workload-A ping -c 4 192.168.0.3
    docker exec workload-A ping -c 4 192.168.0.5

Also check that A cannot ping B (192.168.0.2) or D (192.168.0.4):

    docker exec workload-A ping -c 4 192.168.0.2
    docker exec workload-A ping -c 4 192.168.0.4
