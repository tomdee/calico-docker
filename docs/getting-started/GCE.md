# Running Calico on GCE
Calico is designed to provide high performance massively scalable virtual networking for private data centers. But you 
can also run Calico within a public cloud such as Google Compute Engine (GCE). The following instructions show how to 
network containers using Calico routing and the Calico security model on GCE.

## Getting started with GCE
These instructions describe how to set up two CoreOS hosts on GCE.  For more general background, see 
[the CoreOS on GCE documentation][coreos-gce].

Download and install GCE, then restart your terminal: 
```
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
```
For more information, see Google's [gcloud install instructions][gcloud-instructions].

Log into your account:
```
gcloud auth login
```

In the GCE web console, create a project and enable the Compute Engine API.  
Set the project as the default for gcloud:
```
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```
And set a default zone
```
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
```
## Setting up GCE networking
GCE blocks traffic between hosts by default; run the following command to allow Calico traffic to flow between 
containers on different hosts:
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create calico-ipip --allow 4 --network "default" --source-ranges "10.240.0.0/16"
```
You can verify the rule with this command:
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules list
```

## Spinning up the VMs
Create the VMs by passing in a cloud-init file.

There are three demonstration options depending on whether you are running with libnetwork, Powerstrip or the 
default Docker networking.  Select the appropriate cloud-config based on the demonstration option.

- [User Data for Docker default networking](default-networking/cloud-config) 
- [User Data for libnetwork](libnetwork/cloud-config)  
- [User Data for Powerstrip](powerstrip/cloud-config)
  
A different file is used for the two servers.    
- For the first server, use the `user-data-first`
- For the second server, use the `user-data-others`

For the first server run:

```
gcloud compute instances create \
  calico-1 \
  --image-project coreos-cloud \
  --image coreos-alpha-709-0-0-v20150611 \
  --machine-type n1-standard-1 \
  --metadata-from-file user-data=<PATH_TO_CLOUD_CONFIG>/user-data-first
```

For the second server run:

```
gcloud compute instances create \
  calico-2 \
  --image-project coreos-cloud \
  --image coreos-alpha-709-0-0-v20150611 \
  --machine-type n1-standard-1 \
  --metadata-from-file user-data=<PATH_TO_CLOUD_CONFIG>/user-data-others
```

## Set up the IP Pool before running the demo
SSH into each node using gcloud (names are calico-1 and calico-2):
```
gcloud compute ssh <instance name>
```

On any one of the hosts, create the IP pool Calico will use for your containers:
```
calicoctl pool add 192.168.0.0/16 --ipip --nat-outgoing
```

# Running the demonstration
You can now run through the standard Calico demonstration.  There are three demonstration options depending on 
whether you are running with libnetwork, Powerstrip or the default Docker networking.

- [demonstration with Docker default networking](default-networking/Demonstration.md) 
- [demonstration with libnetwork](libnetwork/Demonstration.md) 
- [demonstration with Powerstrip](powerstrip/Demonstration.md)

## (Optional) Enabling traffic from the internet to containers
Services running on a Calico host's containers in GCE can be exposed to the internet.  Since the containers have IP 
addresses in the private IP range, traffic to the container must be routed using a NAT and an appropriate Calico 
security profile.

Let's create a new security profile and look at the default rules.
```
calicoctl profile add WEB
calicoctl profile WEB rule show
```
You should see the following output.
```
Inbound rules:
   1 allow from tag WEB 
Outbound rules:
   1 allow
```

Let's modify this profile to make it more appropriate for a public webserver by allowing TCP traffic on ports 80 and 
443:

```
calicoctl profile WEB rule add inbound allow tcp to ports 80,443
```

Now, we can list the rules again and see the changes:

```
calicoctl profile WEB rule show
```

should print

```
Inbound rules:
   1 allow from tag WEB 
   2 allow tcp to ports 80,443
Outbound rules:
   1 allow
```

On the same host, create a NAT that forwards port 80 traffic to the new container.

```
sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i ens4v1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT  --to 192.168.2.1:80
```

Lastly, the GCE's firewall rules must be updated for any ports you want to expose. Run this gcloud command to allow 
incoming traffic to port 80:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http \
  --description "Incoming http allowed." --allow tcp:80
```

You should now be able to access the container using the public ip address of your GCE host on port 80 by 
visiting http://<host public ip>:80 or running:

```
curl http://<host public ip>:80
```
